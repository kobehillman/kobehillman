It was love at first sight.

In 2020, I decided to get into learning game development. I have a background in computer technology, but I always thought that game development consisted of opening an application and everything was preset for you. Upon watching my first YouTube tutorial, I realized that if I wanted to develop video games, I was going to have to learn how to code. I created my first ever video game in Unreal Engine using C++, and ever since, I was in love with programming.
 
About a year later, I decided that I would do small game development projects on the side and mainly focus on learning software development. I enrolled in a few online courses, and began my journey in learning programming language theory along with the variety of different programming languages. The languages I've studied consist of C++, C, JavaScript, HTML, and Python. I challenge myself to become more knowledgeable with coding by solving problems that I find online, and completing more online courses.

I'm currently enrolled at Ivy Tech Community College working toward a transferrable AS degree and plan on transferring to a four-year university as a Junior working toward a BS degree.
